## Module 10 Challenge Files

This repo contains the following,
- The SurfsUp directory that contains
    - The climate_starter Jupyter Notebook containing the precipitation and station analysis
    - The app.py file containing python code that generates an API endpoint providing routes to various queries
- The Resources folder containing
    - CSV files for the measurement and station tables
    - The hawaii.sqlite file that I've connected my ORM engine to
- The Images folder containing screenshots of
    - The precipitation bar graph
    - The temperature histogram


##  Analyzing data from weather stations in Hawaii

Alright!! What a challenge this assignment was! With the information learnt in class, we delve into the following -

1. Using Jupyter Notebook to connect to a SQLite database, using the SQLAlchemy Library
2. Analyze the precipitation and temperature data for weather stations across Hawaii and using my knowledge of Pandas and Matplotlib to plot graphs showing the relationship between these factors over a period of 12 months
3. Create an API end point/landing page using Python, that uses SQLAlchemy to establish a connection to our database
4. Create static routes that are straightforward lists indicating pre-selected/pre-filtered data.
5. Create dynamic routes that interact with the user and provide data based on the dates selected.

Throughout this assignment, my code shows the following,
- All imported dependencies at the very beginning of each file
- Name function and variables presented in a readable format (lower case and separated by underscores where needed)
- Defining functions that are reused wherever needed, so as to not repeat code
- Using concise for loops and conditionals
- Contain clear comments on the process
- Files all coded locally and committed through terminal into Github
